  - title: DoozyUI 2.9.4 - Release Notes
    content: "We\u2019ve been tinkering under the hood to fix some bugs that were
      brought to our attention by you guys and we also added some small new features.
      Read on to learn about what changed and what are the new available features.\r\n\r\nNEW
      FEATURES\r\n\u2022 UIElement has a new method 'IsUIElementVisible' that returns
      true if at least one UIElement with the given elementName and elementCategory
      is currently visible. An UIElement is considered visible if its isVisible value
      is true.\r\n\u2022 UIManager and UINavigation have a new public static method
      'ShowAndHide(List<NavigationPointer> show, List<NavigationPointer> hide, bool
      addToNavigationHistory, bool instantAction = false)' that shows and/or hidea
      all the UIElements that have been added to the show and/or hide NavigationPointer
      Lists while also adding this change to the NaviagtionHistory if addToNavigationHistory
      is set to true.\r\n\u2022 UIManager and UINavigation have a new public static
      method 'ShowUiElementAndHideAllTheOthers(string elementName, string elementCategory,
      bool addToNavigationHistory, bool instantAction = false)' that shows an UIElement
      and hides all the others (the UIElements that are visible) whith the addToNavigationHistory
      option.\r\n\u2022 UIManager and UINavigation have a new public static method
      'ShowUiElement(string elementName, string elementCategory, bool addToNavigationHistory,
      bool instantAction = false)' that shows all the UIElements that have the given
      name and category with addToNavigationHistory option.\r\n\u2022 UIManager and
      UINavigation have a new public static method 'HideUiElement(string elementName,
      string elementCategory, bool addToNavigationHistory, bool instantAction = false)'
      that hides all the UIElements that have the given name and category with addToNavigationHistory
      option.\r\n\r\nCHANGES\r\n\u2022 The following methods in the UIElement components
      are now public - InitLoopAnimations, PlayLoopAnimations and StopLoopAnimations.\r\n\u2022
      Moved most static registry databases and methods from the UIManager to each
      corespondent component. The UIManager functionality is still the same, it just
      points to the new databases/methods for each component. We did this as DoozyUI
      3.0 has a clear separation of components and that makes the code more clean
      and easier to work with (also it is more intuitive this way).\r\n\r\nFIXES\r\n\u2022
      Updated the functionality of editing multiple components for the Navigation
      settings. This affects the UIButton, the UIToggle and the GestureDectector.
      Now, you can select several UIButtons and change all their Navigation settings
      at once.\r\n\u2022 UIButton OnClick had a small delay when executing multiple
      clicks/taps in a very short interval. We fixed that and now all the clicks
      happen instantly as intended. Thank you all for your help in tracking down
      this issue.\r\n\u2022 A general editor issue was discovered with all the toggles,
      not behaving as expected when working with multiple components selected. This
      issue has been resolved and not it works as intended with serializedProperties
      controlling all the settings.\r\n\u2022 UIButton editor minor layout issues
      have been resolved.\r\n\u2022 UIToggle not animating when toggled by a ToggleGroup.\r\n\u2022
      UIElement show method had some issues due to class variables, now we use method
      variables that fixed the issues that appared when the orientation changed.

  - title: DoozyUI 3 - News
    content: "NEWS\r\nWe\u2019ve acquired doozyui.com and we are in the process of
      moving all the info about DoozyUI there. A real-time chat option will be available,
      and all the documentation and guides will be added there with supporting how-to
      images and video examples.\r\n\r\nDEVELPOMENT\r\nDoozyUI 3 has entered alpha
      testing and we\u2019re adding a lot of new features and fixing any bugs we
      find before we enter the beta test phase. Right now, the runtime infrastructure
      is almost complete and operational. After the first functionality tests, we\u2019ll
      be moving into adding the editor core (that has been developed separately).\r\nWe\u2019ll
      be looking for some of you (limited availability) to help us out with the beta
      tests, so be on the lookout for our announcement about that, if you are interested.\r\n\r\nFAQ\r\n\u2022
      Will DoozyUI 3 be compatible with previous versions of DoozyUI?\r\n--- As of
      now, the answer is no. The new version has been completely rewritten from the
      ground up. We have been maintaining various old code from version 1 and we
      had to clean up the entire code base to untangle the old patterns and designs.\r\n\r\n\u2022
      What are some of the significant changes implemented in DoozyUI 3?\r\n--- There
      are several significant changes that will lower the development times of your
      UI design. A Node Graph will be responsible for UI navigation purposes; thus,
      you\u2019ll have a clear and easy way of creating, managing and visualizing
      your UI flow. UI Templates will be a staple addition to the system, as you\u2019ll
      be able to design your UI into a template that can be used again and again
      in other projects. There are other new features that we\u2019ll showcase in
      all the relevant places (videos, manual, website).\r\n\r\n\u2022 Will you be
      developing an upgrade tool from previous versions of DoozyUI to DoozyUI 3?\r\n---
      Depending on the number of upgrade requests, we\u2019ll investigate doing just
      that. This will happen only after we release DoozyUI 3.\r"
